**File Naming Convention**
I have named the Pdf file in the following Format : "Day(Assignment-Topic).pdf" 
**for Example :** Day-01(Assignment-TopicName).pdf
â†’ This format includes the day of the **Training**  and the **Topic** of the assignment to ensure easy identification and retrieval.
**Note**: I followed this Pdf file name from Computer Architecture topic to Git topic,
after that I created a folder with the topic name and added all the assignments of that topic .
